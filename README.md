## What is SEAT?

 *Seat* is a web interface that provides a simple and efficient way for school teachers to test and grade their students. 
 
 It addresses a need that other testing platforms do not: the ability to interleave automatically graded questions and manually graded questions in a truly usable fashion, which is one of the main requirements of our client. 
 
 It is lightweight, without some of the cumbersome user interface and features of the more popular learning management systems on the market. 
 
 Seat is streamlined to do one thing and do it very well facilitate the making, taking, and grading of tests, with a full feature set of question types and support.


## Licence

 As of now, this is a closed source project and is under no licence. This will be considered closer to completion of the project.
